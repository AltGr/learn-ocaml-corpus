Question 1
  Found [rank] with compatible type.
  Computing [rank E]
  Success 1: Correct value [0]
  Computing [rank (T (1, Red, E, E))]
  Success 1: Correct value [1]
  Computing [rank (T (2, Red, T (1, Red, E, E), T (1, Yellow, E, E)))]
  Success 1: Correct value [2]
  Computing [rank (T (42, Red, E, E))]
  Success 1: Correct value [42]
Question 2
  Found [makeT] with compatible type.
  Success 1: The heap invariant seems respected.
  Failure: The rank invariant is violated.The following expression:
     | makeT Red E (makeT Red E E)produces the following invalid result:
     | T(1, Red, E, T(1, Red, E, E))
  Failure: The leftist invariant is violated.The following expression:
     | makeT Red E (makeT Red E E)produces the following invalid result:
     | T(1, Red, E, T(1, Red, E, E))
  Success 1: The multiset of elements seems preserved.
Question 3
  Failure: Cannot find  [singleton]
Question 4
  Found [makeT] with compatible type.
  Failure: Cannot find  [union]
Questions 5 and 6
  Failure: Cannot find  [insert]
