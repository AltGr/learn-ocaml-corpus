Questions 5 and 6
  Found [insert] with compatible type.
  Found [extract] with compatible type.
  Failure: One of insert or extract is incorrect.The following sequence of
                                                 operations:
     | empty; insert Red; extract; extractgives rise to the following
                                          sequence of extracted elements:
     | Red; Redwhereas the expected sequence is as follows:
     | Red; <none>
