  Success 1: Correct value [0]
  Computing [rank (T (1, Red, E, E))]
  Success 1: Correct value [1]
  Computing [rank (T (2, Red, T (1, Red, E, E), T (1, Yellow, E, E)))]
  Success 1: Correct value [2]
  Computing [rank (T (42, Red, E, E))]
  Success 1: Correct value [42]
Question 2

  Success 1: The heap invariant seems respected.
  Success 1: The rank invariant seems respected.
  Success 1: The leftist invariant seems respected.
  Success 1: The multiset of elements seems preserved.
Question 3
  Found [singleton] with compatible type.
  Computing [singleton Red]
  Success 1: Correct value [(T (1, Red, E, E))]
  Computing [singleton Yellow]
  Success 1: Correct value [(T (1, Yellow, E, E))]
  Computing [singleton Green]
  Success 1: Correct value [(T (1, Green, E, E))]
Question 4
  Found [makeT] with compatible type.
  Found [union] with compatible type.
  Success 1: The heap invariant seems respected.
  Failure: The multiset of elements is not preserved.The following
                                                     expression:
     | union (
     |   makeT Red (makeT Yellow E E) (
     |     makeT Red E E
     |   )
     | ) (
     |   makeT Red E (
     |     makeT Red E (makeT Red E E)
     |   )
     | )produces the following invalid result:
     | T(
     |   2,
     |   Red,
     |   T(1, Yellow, E, E),
     |   T(
     |     1,
     |     Red,
     |     T(1, Red, T(1, Red, E, E), E),
     |     E
     |   )
     | )
