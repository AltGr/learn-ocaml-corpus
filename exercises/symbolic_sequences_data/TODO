Can one link from one exercise to another exercise?

Adding [@@@warning "-A"] at the top of `test.ml` has no effect.
I still no warnings when running `learn-ocaml build`.

"Unbound module Lazy" in test.ml?

`Test_lib.result` does not seem to correctly protect against non-terminating
computations. An infinite loop (`let rec f x = f x in f 0`) is never
interrupted.

Grading is slow. This limits the number of tests that I can run.
I can run about 10000 tests in one second offline,
but grading in the browser seems slower.
