<p>
  In this exercise, you will experiment with <em>type-directed
  programming</em>.
</p>

<p>
  We give you the example program of the lecture in which two type
  definitions have been changed as in the given prelude. A
  case <code>Tired</code> has been added to type <code>state</code>,
  and a case <code>Sleep</code> has been added to
  type <code>action</code>.
  <br/>
  By clicking the <em>typecheck</em> button, you can notice that
  several warnings are issued by the OCaml compiler. Go through the
  code and fix these warnings as follow.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Update <code>apply_action</code> so that the <code>Sleep</code>
    action turns a character from the <code>Tired</code> state to
    the <code>Hungry</code> state.
  </li>
  <li>
    Update <code>possible_changes_for_character</code> so that
    the <code>Tired</code> state behaves as the <code>Hungry</code>
    state.
  </li>
  <li>
    Update <code>describe_state</code> so that the description of
    the <code>Tired</code> state is <code>"tired"</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Update <code>tell_action</code> so that <code>tell_action
    Sleep</code> is <code>"took a nap"</code>.
  </li>
</ol>
