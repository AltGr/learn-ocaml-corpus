<p>
  In this exercise, we will do some basic two-dimensional geometry.
</p>

<p>
  We represent a point in two dimensions using a pair, as defined by
  type <code>point2d</code> in the given prelude. The first component
  is abscissa (x) and the second component is the ordinate (y).
  Abscissas grow from left to right and ordinates grow from bottom to
  top as illustrated by the following schema:
</p>

<pre>
                          ^ (y)
                          |
                          |
                          |
                          |
   -------------------- (0,0) --------------------> (x)
                          |
                          |
                          |
                          |
</pre>

<p>
  A tetragon is a polygon with four sides. We represent such an object
  using a 4-uple of points, as defined by type <code>tetragon</code>
  in the given prelude. that appear in the following order: the left
  upper point (lup), the right upper point (rup), the left lower point
  (llp) and the right lower point (rlp).
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
   Write a function <code>pairwise_distinct</code> of
   type <code>tetragon -> bool</code> that checks that the points of
   an input tetragon are pairwise distinct. In the sequel, we assume
   that all the points are pairwise distinct.
  </li>
  <li>
   A tetragon is well-formed if the following properties are verified:
   <ol>
     <li>
       The left upper and the left lower points have the lowest abscissa.
     </li>
     <li>
       Between the two leftmost points, the left upper point has the
       greatest ordinate.
     </li>
     <li>
       Between the two rightmost points, the right upper point has the
       greatest ordinate.
     </li>
   </ol>
   Write a function <code>wellformed</code> of type <code>tetragon ->
   bool</code> that returns true if and only if the input tetragon is
   well formed.
  </li>
  <li>
   A simple way to rotate a tetragon by 90 degrees clockwise with
   respect to (0, 0) is to rotate each of its points by exchanging
   their abscissa and ordinate and negating the resulting ordinate.
   <br/> Write a function <code>rotate_point</code> of
   type <code>point2d -> point2d</code> such that <code>rotate_point
   p</code> is the point <code>p</code> rotated as explained in the
   previous paragraph.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once rotated, the points of the tetragon may not be in the right
    order: lup may be now llp, rup may be now llp, etc.  <br/> Write a
    function <code>reorder</code> of type <code>point2d * point2d *
    point2d * point2d -> tetragon</code> that takes 4 pairwise
    distinct points (not necessarily the output of the previous
    function but any 4 points) and returns a wellformed tetragon.
  </li>
  <li>
   Write a function <code>rotate_tetragon</code> that takes a
   well-formed tetragon and returns a well-formed rotated tetragon.
  </li>
</ol>
