<p>
  In this exercise, we will encode imperative stacks
  of <code>int</code>s using the <code>type stack = int array</code>
  as defined in the prelude.
</p>

<p>
  We will use the first cell (cell <code>0</code>) to store the number
  of items in the stack. Then the cells of the array starting
  from <code>1</code> will be used to store the elements in the
  stack. The bottom element of the stack will be stored at
  position <code>1</code>.
</p>

<p>
  The stack will thus have a maximum capacity, being the length of the
  array minus one.
</p>

<ul>
  <li> An empty stack of capacity <code>4</code> would match the following pattern: <br/>

    <code>[| 0 ; _ ; _ ; _ ; _|]</code>
  </li>
  <li> A stack of capacity <code>4</code>
  containing <code>1</code> at the bottom, then <code>2</code> and
  then <code>3</code> at the top would match the following pattern: <br/>

    <code>[| 3 ; 1 ; 2 ; 3 ; _|]</code>
  </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    Define a function <code>create : int -> stack</code> that creates
    a new stack of the given maximum capacity.
  </li>
  <li>
    Define a function <code>push : stack -> int -> unit</code> that
    adds an element as the top of the stack.

    <br/>
    
    The function must fail with the exception <code>Full</code> given
    in the prelude if nothing can be added to the stack.
  </li>
  <li>
    Define a function <code>append : stack -> int array -> unit</code>
    that adds an array of integers as the top of the stack. The first
    element of the array must be at the top of the stack, the others
    in order, up to the last element, which will be the lowest in the
    stack. In other words, the last element of the array
    should be pushed first, etc.

    <br/>
    
    The function must fail with the exception <code>Full</code> given
    in the prelude if some elements could not fit in the stack.  But
    in this case, it should still fill the stack with as many elements
    as possible.
  </li>
  <li>
    Define a function <code>pop : stack -> int</code> that takes an
    element as the top of the stack, removes it from the stack, and
    return it.

    <br/>
    
    The function must fail with the exception <code>Empty</code> given
    in the prelude if nothing can be taken from the stack.
  </li>
</ol>
