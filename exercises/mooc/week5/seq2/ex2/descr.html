<p>
  In this exercise, we will pretty-print directory structures.
</p>

<p>
  The prelude gives the types that we will use to represent directory
  structures. A <code>node</code> in the <code>filesystem</code> is
  either a simple <code>File</code>, a <code>Dir</code>ectory that
  contains a nested <code>filesystem</code>, or
  a <code>Symlink</code>.
  <br/>
  The latter, as on Unix systems, is a fake
  file that redirects to another file. For this, it provides the
  relative path to this target file. The path is the list of directory
  to traverse to get to the target file, followed by the later. If one
  has to go a directory up, we use the common <code>".."</code>
  directory name that represents the parent directory.
  <br/>
  A <code>filesystem</code> is a list of named nodes. An example
  <code>filesystem</code> is given below, in the format that you will
  have to produce. Don't worry, we'll break this piece by piece.
</p>

<pre>
  /photos
  | /march
  | | photo_1.bmp
  | | photo_2.bmp
  | | photo_3.bmp
  | | index.html
  | /april
  | | photo_1.bmp
  | | photo_2.bmp
  | | index.html
  /videos
  | video1.avi
  | video2.avi
  | video3.avi
  | video4.avi
  | best.avi -> video4.avi
  | index.html
  /indexes
  | videos.html -> ../videos/index.html
  | photos_march.html -> ../photos/march/index.html
  | photos_april.html -> ../photos/april/index.html
  | photos_may.html -> INVALID
</pre>

<p>
  This output was generated from the following OCaml structure.

<pre>
[ "photos", Dir
    [ "march", Dir
        [ "photo_1.bmp", File ;
          "photo_2.bmp", File ;
          "photo_3.bmp", File ;
          "index.html", File ] ;
      "april", Dir
        [ "photo_1.bmp", File ;
          "photo_2.bmp", File ;
          "index.html", File ] ] ;
  "videos", Dir
    [ "video1.avi", File ;
      "video2.avi", File ;
      "video3.avi", File ;
      "video4.avi", File ;
      "best.avi", Symlink [ "video4.avi" ] ;
      "index.html", File ] ;
  "indexes", Dir
    [ "videos.html",
      Symlink [ ".." ; "videos" ; "index.html" ] ;
      "photos_march.html",
      Symlink [ ".." ; "photos" ; "march" ; "index.html" ] ;
      "photos_april.html",
      Symlink [ ".." ; "photos" ; "april" ; "index.html" ] ;
      "photos_may.html",
      Symlink [ ".." ; "photos" ; "may" ; "index.html" ] ] ]
</pre>

<ol>
  <li>
    Write a function <code>print_path: string list -> unit</code> that
    prints a relative path (the argument of a <code>Symlink</code>)
    and pretty prints it as shown in the example display, using
    slashes (<code>'/'</code>) as separator.
  </li>
  <li>
    As you can see in the example, the depth of a file in
    the <code>filesystem</code> (the number of nested folders that are
    its ancestors) is represented by a sequence of vertical lines.
    Write a function <code>print_file: int -> string -> unit</code>
    that prints a file name, with the given number of <code>"| "</code>
    in front of it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a similar function <code>print_symlink: int -> string ->
    string list -> unit</code> that prints the link name, with the
    given number of <code>"| "</code> in front of it, and the relative
    path (preceded by an arrow <code>" -> "</code>).
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a similar function <code>print_dir: int -> string ->
    unit</code> that prints the dir name, with the given number
    of <code>"| "</code> in front of it, and the
    prepended <code>'/'</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a function <code>print_filesystem: filesystem -> unit</code>
    that traverses the filesystem, producing the same display as in
    the example. You will probably need an auxiliary, recursive
    function, and you will have to use the previous answers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a function <code>resolve: string list -> string list ->
      string list</code>. It takes as parameters:
    <ol>
      <li>The full path from the root to a symlink, including its
	name. In the given example, that could be for instance <code>[
	  "indexes" ; "photos_april.html" ]</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
	The relative path for this symlink. Here, that would
	be <code>[ ".." ; "photos" ; "april" ; "index.html" ]</code>.
      </li>
    </ol>
    The function returns the full path from the root to the target of
    the symlink. Here, we should get <code>[ "photos" ; "april" ;
    "index.html" ]</code>. Note that it may not be as easy as it
    seems, so you may think about it before plunging into the code.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a function <code>file_exists : filesystem -> string list ->
    bool</code> that tells if a file exists in
    the <code>filesystem</code>. The path is the full absolute path to
    the file, and the target must be a <code>File</code>, not
    a <code>Dir</code> or a <code>Symlink</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Update your function <code>print_filesystem: filesystem ->
    unit</code> so that it replaces the printed relative path
    by <code>"INVALID"</code> when the symlink cannot be resolved to
    an existing file.
  </li>
</ol>
