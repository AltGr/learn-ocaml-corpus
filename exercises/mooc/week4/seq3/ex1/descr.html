<p>
  Every triangle has a circumscribed circle, that is a circle that
  goes through the three points of a given triangle. Trigonometry
  tells us that the radius of this circle is
  `s/(2*cos(a/2)*2*cos(b/2)*2*cos(c/2))`
  where <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> are the
  angles of the triangle, and <code>s</code> is its circumference.

<ol>
  <li>
    Define a function <code>ccr: float -> float -> float -> float ->
    float</code> that takes as
    arguments <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>
    and <code>s</code>, and returns the radius of circumscribed circle
    as described above.
  </li>
  <li>
    Update <code>ccr</code> so that it does as much work as possible
    when partially applied to each argument, and minimizes the total
    number of operations (multiplications, divisions and calls
    to <code>cos</code>).
  </li>
</ol>
