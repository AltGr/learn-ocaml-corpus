  In this exercise, we will write a small program that computes some operations
  on integers. We will use a small datatype <code>operation</code> that describes
  all the operations to perform to compute the result.
  For example, suppose we want to do the following computation:
  <br />
  <code>mul (add 0 1) (mul 3 4)</code>
  <br />
  We can describe it as:
  <code>
    Op ("mul",
      Op ("add", Value 0, Value 1),
      Op ("mul", Value 3, Value 4))
  </code>
  <br />

  The <code>Op</code> constructor takes as a first argument
  a <code>string</code>, which is the name of the function that is stored in
  an <code>environment</code>. We suppose there exists a
  variable <code>initial_env</code> that contains some predefined functions.

  <li>
    First of all, we need a way to find a function in an environment of
    type <code>env</code>, which is basically a list of tuples. Each of these tuples
    contains a <code>string</code>, which is the name of the function, and a
    value of type <code>int -> int -> int</code>, which is basically a function
    that takes two arguments of type <code>int</code> and returns
    an <code>int</code> as a result.  <br />

    Write a function <code>lookup_function : string -> env -> (int -> int ->
    int)</code> that returns the function associated to a name in an
    environment. If there is no function with the name given, you can
    return <code>invalid_arg "lookup_function"</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Another useful feature would be to add functions to a given
    environment. Write the function <code>add_function : string -> (int
    -> int -> int) -> env -> env</code> that takes an environment <code>e</code>, a
    name for the function <code>n</code> and a function <code>f</code>, and
    returns a new environment that contains the function <code>f</code> that is
    associated to the name <code>n</code>.
    <br /><br />
    What you can notice now is that unless you put explicit annotations,
    those two previous functions should be polymorphic and work on any list of
    couples. Actually, <code>lookup_function</code> could have been written
    as <code>List.assoc</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
   Create a variable <code>my_env: env</code> that is the initial environment
   plus a function associated to the name <code>"min"</code> that takes two
   numbers and returns the lowest. You cannot use the already
   defined <code>Pervasives.min</code> function, nor any <code>let
   .. in</code>. Take advantage of lambda expressions!
  </li>
  <li>
    Now that we have correctly defined the operations to use the environment, we
    can write the function that computes an operation. Write a
    function <code>compute: env -> operation -> int</code> that takes an
    environment and an operation description, and computes this
    operation.
    The result is either:
    <ul>
      <li>Directly the value.</li>
      <li>An operation that takes two computed values and a function from the
      environment.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Let's be a bit more efficient and use the <em>over-application</em>: suppose
    a function <code>id: 'a -> 'a</code>, then <code>id id</code> will also have
    type <code>'a -> 'a</code>, since the <code>'a</code> is instantiated
    with <code>'a -> 'a </code>. Using that principle, we can
    apply <code>id</code> to itself infinitely since it will always return a
    function. Write a function <code>compute_eff : env -> operation ->
    int</code> that takes an environment and an operation, and computes
    it. However, you cannot use <code>let</code> inside the function!
  </li>
</ol>
