<p>
  The goal of this project is to synthesize natural language sentences
  using information extracted from an existing text corpus.
</p>

<p>
  For this, given a text corpus as input, we will first compute the
  frequency of all sequences of two words in the original text; then
  we will use this information to produce new sentences by randomly
  collating these sequences with the same frequencies.
</p>

<p>
  This method is known under the term of <em>Markov chain</em>. From
  the input text, we compute a transition table that associates to
  each word the list of words that may appear after it, with their
  relative frequencies.
</p>

<p>
  For instance, if we examine <em>”I am a man and my dog is a good
    dog and a good dog makes a good man”</em>, delimiting it with
  <code>”START”</code> and <code>”STOP”</code> to identify the
  beginning and end of the sentence, we end up with the
  transition table on the right.
</p>

<p>
  This table can then be used to generate new text that ressembles the
  input in the following way: starting from the <code>"START"</code>
  word, choose one of the words that may appear after it, with the
  probability found in the table, add it to the output, then iterate
  the process until the <code>"STOP"</code> word is found. Below are
  some example sentences produced using this table.
</p>

<pre>
START I am a good  man STOP ; START I am a good dog  is a good dog and
my dog and my  dog is a man and my  dog and a man STOP ;  START I am a
good dog is a man and my dog makes a good man STOP ; START I am a good
dog makes a good dog is a good dog  and a good dog makes a good dog is
a man STOP ; START I am a good dog and a man and a good dog and a good
man and a good dog is a good dog  is a good man and a man STOP ; START
I am a good dog and a good dog and my dog is a man STOP ; START I am a
man STOP ;  START I am a good dog  is a good dog is a  good dog and my
dog is a man STOP ; START I am a good man STOP ; START I am a good dog
makes a good dog and a good dog is a good dog is a good man and my dog
is a good dog and  my dog and a good man and a good  dog is a good man
STOP ; START I am a man and my dog and my dog is a good dog and a good
dog makes a man STOP
</pre>

<p>
  This project is decomposed in three parts.
</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-latin">
  <li>
    First, we will build a quick prototype, that goes from an input
    sentence to a randomly generated sentences via a distribution
    table as the ones above.
  </li>
  <li>
    Then we will use better data structures to enhance the performance
    so that we can use larger texts, such as small books, as input.
  </li>
  <li>
    After that, we will enhance the quality of input and output, by
    analysing in a smarter way the input text corpus, and by
    considering sequences of more than two words.
  </li>
</ol>

<p style="background:#eee;border:1px #ccc solid;padding:10px">
  <strong>Note:</strong> this project may take more time to be graded,
  because it is longer than simple exercises, and because it is tested
  on large inputs. We suggest that you use the typecheck button and
  the toplevel extensively, so that you are reasonnably sure of your
  code before submitting it to the tests. Also, we added a function
  <code>grade_only : int list -> unit</code>, that you may
  call in your code to select the exercises to grade. All other
  exercises won't be graded at all, and considered failed. For
  instance, if you write <code>grade_only [ 3 ] ;;</code> at the
  beginning of your file, only exercise 3 will be tested.
</p>

<h2>Part A: A First Draft</h2>

<p>
  Our first goal will be to build such a table and generate sentences
  from it, quick and dirty style, using lists and their predefined
  operators. Consider using as much as possible the <code>List</code> module
  (<code>List.assoc</code>, <code>List.length</code>, <code>List.nth</code>,
  etc.) and don't think about efficiency.
</p>

<p style="background:#eee;border:1px #ccc solid;padding:10px">
  In this exercise, we will use associative lists as the data
  structure that links each word to its possible suffixes. Associative
  lists are often used in prototypes or non critical programs because
  they are very easy to use and debug. Their major downfall is
  the complexity of searching for an element.

  <br/>

  The type of an associative list that maps <code>string</code> keys
  to <code>'a</code> values is simply <code>(string * 'a) list</code>.
  The value associated with a key <code>"x"</code> is simply the right
  component of the first pair in the list whose left component
  is <code>"x"</code>. This lookup is already defined in the standard
  library as <code>List.assoc</code>. Hence, setting the value of
  <code>"x"</code> to <code>3</code>, for instance, is just adding
  <code>("x",3)</code> in front of the list. To remove an element, you
  can just use <code>List.filter</code> with the right predicate.
</p>

<p>The type of lookup tables for this exercise is</p>

<pre>
type ltable = (string * string list) list
</pre>

<ol>
  <li>
    Write a function <code>words : string -> string list</code> that
    takes a sentence and returns the list of its words. As a first
    approximation, will work on single sentences in simple english, so
    you can consider sequences of roman letters and digits as words,
    and everything else as separators. If you want to build words bit
    by bit, you can experiment with the
    <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Buffer.html">Buffer</a>
    module. Beware, this preliminary function may not be as easy as it
    seems.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write <code>build_ltable : string list -> ltable</code> that builds an
    associative list mapping each word present in the input text to
    all its possible successors (including duplicates). The table
    should also contain <code>"START"</code> that points to the first
    word and <code>"STOP"</code> that is pointed by the last word.

    <br/>

    For instance, a correct (and minimal) table for <code>"x y z y x y"</code> looks like:
    <pre>
[ ("z", [ "y" ]);
  ("x", [ "y" ; "y" ]);
  ("START", [ "x" ]);
  ("y", [ "x" ; "z" ; "STOP" ]) ]
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Write the random selection function
    <code>next_in_ltable : (string * string list) list -> string - > string</code>
    which takes a table, a given word and returns a valid successor of
    this word. Your function should respect the probability
    distribution (which should be trivially ensured by the presence of
    the duplicates in the successor lists).
  </li>
  <li>
    Write the random generation function
    <code>walk_ltable : (string * string list) list -> string list</code>
    which takes a table and returns a sequence of words that form a
    valid random sentence (without the <code>"START"</code> and <code>"STOP"</code>).
  </li>
</ol>

<p style="background:#eee;border:1px #ccc solid;padding:10px">
  You can use <code>display_quote: string list -> unit</code> to
  display the generated texts.
</p>

<h2>Part B: Performance Improvements</h2>

<p>
  Now, we want to use more efficient data structures, so that we can
  take larger inputs and build bigger transition tables.
</p>

<p style="background:#eee;border:1px #ccc solid;padding:10px">
  In this exercise, we will use hash tables, predefined in OCaml in the
  <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Hashtbl.html">Hashtbl</a>
  module. Used correctly, hash table provide both fast insertion and
  extraction. Have a look at the documentation of the module. In
  particular, don't miss the difference between <code>Hashtbl.add</code>
  and <code>Hashtbl.replace</code> (you'll probably want to use the latter
  most of the time).
</p>

<p>The types for this exercise are:</p>

<pre>
type distribution =
  { total : int ;
    amounts : (string * int) list }
type htable = (string, distribution) Hashtbl.t
</pre>

<ol start="5">
  <li>
    In the simple version, we stored for each word the complete list
    of suffixes, including duplicates. This is a valid data structure
    to use when building the table since adding a new suffix in front
    of the list is fast. But when generating, it means computing the
    length of this list each time, and accessing its random
    <code>nth</code> element, which is slow if the list is long.

    <br/>

    Write <code>compute_distribution : string list -> distribution</code> that
    takes a list of strings and returns a pair containing its length
    and an association between each string present in the original
    list and its number of occurrences.

    <br/>

    For instance,
    <code>compute_distribution ["a";"b";"c";"b";"c";"a";"b";"c";"c";"c"]</code>
    should give <code>{ total = 10 ; amounts = [("c", 5); ("b", 3); ("a", 2)] }</code>.

    <br/>

    <strong>Hint:</strong> a first step that simplifies the problem is
    to sort the list.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a new version of <code>build_htable : string list -> htable</code>
    that creates a hash table instead of an associative list, so that
    both table building and sentence generation will be faster.

    <br/>

    Like the associative list, the table is indexed by the words, each
    word being associated to its successors. But instead of just
    storing the list of successors, it will use the format of the
    previous question.

    <br/>

    <strong>Hint:</strong> You can first define an intermediate table
    of type <code>(string, string list) Hashtbl.t</code> that stores
    the lists of successors with duplicates. Then you traverse this
    intermediate table with <code>Hashtbl.iter</code>, and for each
    word, you add the result of <code>compute_distribution</code> in
    the final table.
  </li>
  <li>
    Define <code>next_in_htable : htable -> string -> string</code>
    that does the same thing as <code>next_in_ltable</code> for the
    new table format.
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally, define <code>walk_htable : htable -> string list</code>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Part C: Quality Improvements</h2>

<ol start="9">
  <li>
    If we want to generate sentences from larger corpuses, such as the
    ones of the <code>ebooks_corpus</code> given in the prelude, we
    cannot just ignore the punctuation. We also want to generate text
    using not only the beginning of the original text, but the start
    of any sentence in the text.

    <br/>

    Define <code>sentences : string -> string list list</code> that
    splits a string into a list of sentences such as:

    <ul>
      <li>
          uninterrupted sequences of roman letters, numbers, and non
          ASCII characters (in the range <code>'\128'..'\255'</code>) are words;
      </li>
      <li>
        single punctuation characters
        <code>';'</code>, <code>','</code>, <code>':'</code>, <code>'-'</code>,
        <code>'"'</code>, <code>'\''</code>, <code>'?'</code>, <code>'!'</code>
        and <code>'.'</code>
        are words;
      </li>
      <li>
          punctuation characters
          <code>'?'</code>, <code>'!'</code> and <code>'.'</code>
          terminate sentences;
      </li>
      <li>
          everything else is a separator;
      </li>
      <li>
          and your function should not return any empty sentence.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Now, we will drastically improve the results by matching sequences
    of more than two words. We will thus update the format of our tables
    again, and use the following <code>ptable</code>
    type (which looks a lot like the previous one).
</p>

<pre>
type ptable =
  { prefix_length : int ;
    table : (string list, distribution) Hashtbl.t }
</pre>

<p>
    So let's say we want to identify sequences of `N` words in the
    text. The <code>prefix_length</code> field contains `N - 1`.  The
    <code>table</code> field associates each list of `N - 1` words
    from the text with the distribution of its possible successors.
</p>

<table id="markov">
    <tr class="h"><td>prefix</td><td>→</td><td>next</td><td>freq</td></tr>
    <tr class="a"><td>["START"; "START"]</td><td>→</td><td>"I"</td><td>100%</td></tr>
    <tr class="b"><td>["START"; "I"]</td><td>→</td><td>"am"</td><td>100%</td></tr>
    <tr class="a"><td>["I"; "am"]</td><td>→</td><td>"a"</td><td>100%</td></tr>
    <tr class="b"><td>["am"; "a"]</td><td>→</td><td>"man"</td><td>100%</td></tr>
    <tr class="a"><td>["man"; "and"]</td><td>→</td><td>"my"</td><td>100%</td></tr>
    <tr class="b"><td>["is"; "a"]</td><td>→</td><td>"good"</td><td>100%</td></tr>
    <tr class="a"><td>["and"; "my"]</td><td>→</td><td>"dog"</td><td>100%</td></tr>
    <tr class="b"><td>["my"; "dog"]</td><td>→</td><td>"is"</td><td>100%</td></tr>
    <tr class="a"><td>["makes"; "a"]</td><td>→</td><td>"good"</td><td>100%</td></tr>
    <tr class="b"><td>["a"; "good"]</td><td>→</td><td>"man"</td><td>33%</td></tr>
    <tr class="b"><td></td><td>|</td><td>"dog"</td><td>66%</td></tr>
    <tr class="a"><td>["dog"; "is"]</td><td>→</td><td>"a"</td><td>100%</td></tr>
    <tr class="b"><td>["and"; "a"]</td><td>→</td><td>"good"</td><td>100%</td></tr>
    <tr class="a"><td>["good"; "dog"]</td><td>→</td><td>"makes"</td><td>50%</td></tr>
    <tr class="a"><td></td><td>|</td><td>"and"</td><td>50%</td></tr>
    <tr class="b"><td>["dog"; "and"]</td><td>→</td><td>"a"</td><td>100%</td></tr>
    <tr class="a"><td>["a"; "man"]</td><td>→</td><td>"and"</td><td>100%</td></tr>
    <tr class="b"><td>["good"; "man"]</td><td>→</td><td>"STOP"</td><td>100%</td></tr>
    <tr class="a"><td>["dog"; "makes"]</td><td>→</td><td>"a"</td><td>100%</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
    The table on the right gives the lookup table for the example given
    at the beginning of the project:  <em>”I am a man and my dog is a
    good dog and a good dog makes a good man”</em>, and a size of
    `2`. You can see that the branching points are fewer and make a bit
    more sense.

    <br/>

    As you can see, we will use <code>"STOP"</code> as an end marker as
    before. But instead of a single <code>"START"</code> we will use as
    a start marker a prefix of the same size as the others, filled with
    <code>"START"</code>.
</p>

<ol start="10">
    <li>
        First, define <code>start: int -> string list</code> that makes
        the start prefix for a given size (<code>start 0 = []</code>,
        <code>start 1 = [ "START" ]</code>, <code>start 2 = [ "START" ; "START" ]</code>,
        etc.).
    </li>
    <li>
        Define <code>shift: string list -> string -> string list</code>.
        It removes the front element of the list and puts the
        new element at the end.
        (<code>shift [ "A" ; "B" ; "C" ] "D" = [ "B" ; "C" ; "D" ]</code>,
        <code>shift [ "B" ; "C" ; "D" ] "E" = [ "C" ; "D" ; "E" ]</code>,
        etc.).
    </li>
    <li>
        Define <code>build_ptable : string list -> int -> ptable</code> that
        builds a table for a given prefix length, using the two previous
        functions.
    </li>
    <li>
        Define <code>walk_ptable : ptable -> string list</code> that
        generates a sentence from a given <code>ptable</code>. Unless you
        put specific annotations, <code>next_in_htable</code> should be
        polymorphic enough to work on the field <code>table</code> of a
        <code>ptable</code>, so you don't have to rewrite one. If you
        want, since we now have proper sentence splitting, you can
        generate multi-sentence texts, by choosing randomly to continue
        from the start after encountering a <code>"STOP"</code>.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Finally, the most funny texts are generated when mixing various
    kinds of inputs together (pirate stories, history books, recipes,
    political news, etc.).
</p>

<ol start="14">
    <li>
        Define <code>merge_ptables: ptable list -> ptable</code> that combines
        several tables together (you may fail with an exception if the
        prefix sizes are inconsistent).
    </li>
</ol>

<p style="background:#eee;border:1px #ccc solid;padding:10px">
    Now you can try and generate some texts using larger inputs, such
    as short novels! The prelude provides a few samples, otherwise
    <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutemberg</a>
    is a good source.

    You can use <code>display_quote: string list -> unit</code> to
    display the generated texts.
</p>

<pre>
let sauce_ptable =
   merge_ptables
     (List.map
        (fun s -> build_ptable s 2)
        (sentences some_cookbook_sauce_chapter)) ;;
display_quote (walk_ptable sauce_ptable) ;;
</pre>
