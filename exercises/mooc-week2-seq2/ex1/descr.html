  On planet Shadokus, a year has 5 months, each month has 4 days, each
  day has 3 hours and each hour has 2 minutes. A calendar date is
  therefore defined as the record type <code>date</code> of the given
  prelude.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    A date is well-formed if its year index is <code>&gt;= 1</code>,
    its month index is <code>&gt;= 1</code> and <code>&lt;= 5</code>,
    its day index is <code>&gt;= 1</code> and <code>&lt;= 4</code>,
    its hour index is <code>&gt;= 0</code> and <code>&lt;= 2</code>,
    and its minute index is <code>&gt;= 0</code> and <code>&lt;=
      1</code>.

    <br/>

    The start of year <code>12</code> would be:
    <pre>{ year = 12; month = 1; day = 1; hour = 0; minute = 0 }</pre>

    The end of year <code>12</code> would be:
    <pre>{ year = 12; month = 5; day = 4; hour = 2; minute = 1 }</pre>

    <br/>

    Write a function <code>wellformed : date -> bool</code> which
    checks that the input date is well formed.

    On planet Shadokus, the origin of time is the discovery of the
    Big-Lambda-Machine, a magical computer that evaluates the infinite
    lambda-term of time. It is defined by
    value <code>the_origin_of_time</code> of the given prelude.
    <br/>
    Write a function <code>next : date -> date</code> which computes
    the date which comes one minute after the input date.
  </li>
  <li>
    In this computer, the time is represented by an integer that
    counts the number of minutes since <code>1/1/1 0:0</code> (the
    origin of time).
    <br/>
    Write a function <code>of_int : int -> date</code> that converts
    such an integer into a <code>date</code>.
  </li>
</ol>
