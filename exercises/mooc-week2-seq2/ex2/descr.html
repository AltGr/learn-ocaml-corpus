  The given prelude defines three types, one for three dimensional
   points, another for velocity vectors in three dimensions, and
   another one representing moving objects in space.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Write a function <code>move : point -> dpoint -> point</code> such
    that <code>move p dp</code> is the point <code>p</code> whose
    coordinates have been updated according to <code>dp</code>.
    <br/>
    (<code>x</code> is now <code>x +. dx</code>, <code>y</code> is now
    <code>y +. dy</code>, <code>z</code> is now <code>z +. dz</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a function <code>next : physical_object ->
    physical_object</code> such that <code>next o</code> is the
    physical object <code>o</code> at time <code>t + dt</code>.
    <br/>
    The position of <code>next o</code> is the position
    of <code>o</code> moved according to its velocity vector.
  </li>
  <li>
    Suppose that these objects are spheres whose radius
    is <code>1.0</code>.
    <br/>
    Write a function <code>will_collide_soon : physical_object ->
    physical_object -> bool</code> that tells if at the next instant,
    the two spheres will intersect.
  </li>
</ol>
