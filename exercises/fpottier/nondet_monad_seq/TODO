-- about this exercise ---------------------------------------------------------

* Add a link to the exercise where the nondeterminism monad is used.

* Should `fix` be part of the constructors?
  How do we define `nats`?

* Should also test computations that are expected to produce an infinite
  number of results. E.g., grade `nats`.

* The error messages that are produced when the code is not lazy (too eager)
  are admittedly cryptic. Could we produce a better explanation?

* Some tests that succeed when run in batch mode
  fail with `Stack_overflow` when run in Firefox.
