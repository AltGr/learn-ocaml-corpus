  In this exercise, we will unveil the basics of the grading system.

  <strong>Note:</strong> This exercise is about exceptions, but it
  uses the <code>unit</code> type that is only presented in the next
  sequence.

  <li>
    For each question, we call both your function and a reference
    function on a list of randomly sampled test cases, and observe the
    results. We also have to handle the case where a function raises
    an exception instead of producing a result. Sometimes, we even
    expect your function to raise an exception, and want to compare it
    to the exception raised by the reference function.

    <br/>

    For this, we use the <code>'a result</code> type given in the
    prelude.

    <br/>

    Define a function <code>exec: ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b
    result</code>, that calls the given function on the given
    argument, and returns <code>Ok</code> with the result if
    everything went well, and <code>Error</code> with the exception
    raised, if there was one.
  </li>
  <li>
    To be able to provide you with the nice error reports, we use an
    intermediate type for producing reports, similar to the one given
    in the prelude.

    <br/>

    Define a function <code>compare</code> with the following signature.
    <pre>compare : 'a result -> 'a result -> ('a -> string) -> message</pre>
    This function will take first the user function's result and then
    the reference function's result. It also takes a printer
    compatible with the return type, to display the results as in one
    the following cases.
    <ul>
      <li><code>("got correct value 13", Successful)</code></li>
      <li><code>("got unexpected value 13", Failed)</code></li>
      <li><code>("got correct exception Exit", Successful)</code></li>
      <li><code>("got unexpected exception Exit", Failed)</code></li>
    </ul>
    You must respect the exact wording for your solution to be
    accepted. To display exceptions, you can use the
    provided <code>exn_to_string</code> function.
  </li>
  <li>
    Then we define random samplers for each type of data that will be
    passed to your function. For a given type <code>'a</code>, a
    random sampler simply has type <code>unit -> 'a</code>, an
    imperative function that returns a new value of
    type <code>'a</code> every time you give it a unit.

    <br/>

    Define a function <code>test</code> with the following signature.
    <pre>test : ('a -> 'b) -> ('a -> 'b) -> (unit -> 'a) -> ('b -> string) -> report</pre>
    This function must proceed to exactly 10 tests, calling the
    sampler each time, and return the list of messages. For each
    sample, you will <code>exec</code> the user function (the first
    parameter), then <code>exec</code> the reference function,
    and <code>compare</code> the <code>result</code>s. It will then
    return the list containing the 10 comparison <code>message</code>s.

    <br/>

    Your solution must respect the constraint that the first call to
    the sampler corresponds to the first message of the list, the
    second to the second, etc. Be cautious about not reversing the
    list. And since the sampler is an imperative, remember to use
     <code>let</code> ... <code>in</code> constructs if necessary, to
    force the order of evaluation.
